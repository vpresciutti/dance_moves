This repo is a backup of a very special list of Slack emojis.  There is a JSON file with direct URL links to all of the emojis, although these may be cached/ephemeral, so I do not know how long those links will work.

The emojis themselves are located in alphabetical directories under the /img folder, and each should be named based on what their emoji name/alias was in the Slack client.

I do not know of an easy way to bulk import these into another Slack instance.  If you know of one, please let me know.
